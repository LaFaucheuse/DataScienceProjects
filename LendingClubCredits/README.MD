**LENDING CLUB CREDITS**

In this project, we want to model a borrower's credit risk. For this, we use financial lending data from Lending Club, which is a marketplace for personal loans. It basically matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.

**The data**
Data for all of the approved and declined loan applications are realeased periodically on the Lending Club website. It is possible to download datasets for a given year range in CSV format. Datasets come with a data dictionary in XLS format, which contains information on the different column names. It is available here : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191B2yJ4H1ZPXq0_ByhUgWMFZOYem5jFz0Y3by_7YBY4/edit

For this project, we use approved loans data from 2007 to 2011 for a better accuracy, since most of the loans have already finished. You can find the CSV file in this repository.

**Problematic**
The aim of this project is to determine which loans are more likely to be paid off from the perspective of a conservative investor who only wants to invest in the loans that have a good chance of being paid off on time.

How can we accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time ?

We use machine learning models to answer this question.
